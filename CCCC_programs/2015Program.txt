To increase the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups—African
Americans, Asian Americans, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and other Latino
and Latina Americans, and American Indians—CCCC has established the Scholars
for the Dream Travel Awards. The awards celebrate the scholarly contributions of
first-time presenters at CCCC who are members of these groups. By providing some
funding for these scholars to travel to the Conference and to share their work with us,
we hope to make the term "underrepresented" past history.

		Chair’s Address
		Thursday, 8:30–10:00 a.m.
Ain’t No Walls Behind the Sky, Baby!
Funk, Flight, and Freedom

When I think of CCCC as an organization, and of the many
names we use to describe our intellectual work, I imagine
Captain Sisko peering over the Promenade  on Star Trek’s
Deep Space Nine, looking at the interaction of all kinds of
human and extraterrestrial life, and thinking about what it
means to be charged with the mission of providing and running the hub that stands as the way station at the edge of an
incomprehensible vastness of as yet unexplored space.  As
an organization, we are a hub for many disparate, yet related
Adam Banks
academic pursuits. As an academic discipline that refuses
University of
to be disciplined, we have long used gateway metaphors to
Kentucky
describe our role in the university; we serve as the hub, or
Lexington
transit station that has the potential to touch every student
as they make their way in academic work, no matter what
disciplines or areas of study they might explore.  We have long thought about what
it means to be a hub for the intellectual work our students do, inside and outside
academic walls. We think intensely and attentively about what it means to prepare
students to write and communicate in academic and workplace settings. We have a
long history of thinking together about writing and communication as keys to our
students’ intellectual freedom and internal yearnings. We have also begun to think as
carefully about what it means for students to be able to communicate thoughtfully in
various kinds of community engaged work.
But what would  it mean to become that kind of hub and network for the rest of the
academy and for the publics and communities we serve off campus?  Despite the
political and budgetary pressures on higher education in general; despite the uncertainties of how our colleges and universities will respond to this uncertain climate;
despite our desires to demonstrate our excellence and rich intellectual history; despite the unjust labor conditions constraining so many of our faculty and programs;
despite the injustices contaminating the worlds of so many of our students, we find
ourselves at a moment when we are freer than we have ever been to fly on to places
we have never been, to re-vision who we are and the work we are here to do.
In this year’s Chair’s Address, "Ain’t No Walls Behind the Sky, Baby! Funk, Flight

and Futuristic Visions," I will travel a little through time and space to join Captain
Sisko on the DS9 Promenade to look from a different vantage point at the work we
do for our students, for our colleagues in other disciplines across the academy, for
higher education generally, and for communities we have a chance to build with and
serve outside our walls.  The address will challenge us to be explorers in this moment
rather than to be content to stay home and do what we know we do well--to "fly on
and reach for the stars" as funkateer Bootsy Collins encourages us to do. The talk
will also identify some specific challenges we must address, and will encourage us
to experiment, play, and even fail in our response to these challenges in order for us
to drop our limits and fly on to become something different than we have ever been.
Adam J. Banks is Professor of Writing, Rhetoric, and Digital Studies at the University of Kentucky. He is the author of Digital Griots and Race, Rhetoric and Technology: Searching for Higher Ground.

CCCC TRIBAL COLLEGE FACULTY FELLOWSHIP
In March 2003, the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC)
initiated a new program, the Tribal College Faculty Fellowship Program. The Tribal
College Faculty Fellowship offers financial aid to selected faculty members currently
working at tribally controlled colleges to attend the CCCC Conference.  This year
we will be awarding up to four Tribal College Faculty Fellowships in the amount of
$750 each. With this Fellowship, CCCC hopes to create new opportunities for Tribal
College Faculty members to become involved in CCCC and for CCCC to carry out
its mission of serving as a truly representative national advocate for language and
literacy education. Applicants are asked to submit a letter describing who they are as
teachers and what they teach at their tribal college, what their research interests are,
and what they hope to gain from the experience of attending CCCC (how it could
help in their teaching or research). A selection committee including American Indian
Caucus members reviews applications for the Tribal College Faculty Fellowship.
Fellowships are awarded based on overall quality of the application letter.

A Discussion about the 2022 CCCC Vision Statement
1:00–2:00 p.m.

What will our organization look like in 2022? Where is our organization headed? What actions do we need to take to achieve that vision? This discussion will
consider the CCCC Strategic Governance Vision Statement of November 2012:
By 2022, CCCC will be a clear, trusted public voice for the teaching and
learning of writing, composition, rhetoric, and literacy in all higher education contexts. We will advocate for a broad definition of writing (including composition, digital production, and diverse language practices) that
emphasizes its value as a human activity that empowers individuals and
communities to shape their worlds. We will be the leading voice in public
discussions about what it means to be an effective writer and to deliver
quality writing instruction. We will provide conditions under which teachers and scholars can discuss, build, and practice sustainable, relevant, and
ethical models of teaching and learning. We will encourage and support
a wide and vibrant range of scholarship at the leading edge of knowledge
about writing, composition, rhetoric, and literacy. To support this work,
CCCC will enhance participation by members who represent a diversity of
races, cultures, languages, identities, institutions, and institutional roles.
