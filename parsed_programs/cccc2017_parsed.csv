Participants will address questions such as: â€¢ How can rhetoric and composition studies help us to understand, resist, and reframe patriarchal practices so deeply embedded in institutions of higher education? â€¢ How can we best leverage the institutional locations of rhetoric and composition programs, writing programs, and writing centers to address systemic sexism and exclusion in our field and in the academy? â€¢ How can we use our pedagogy to shift the culture of sexism, discrimination, and exclusion? What are the pedagogical potentials and risks of interruption (for instructors, students, administrators, etc.)? Because the primary objective of this Cultivate session is to cultivate a space in which feminist compositionists and rhetoricians build our capacity to take strategic action, we hope these questions will enable attendees to work together to identify specific approaches to interruption as feminist praxis, including how we might sustain ourselves as professionals and how we can implement interruption as a rhetorical tool for social justice education and anti-oppression across institutions."

Chris Anson,North Carolina State University,NA,Cultivating Response: Seeing Teacher Comments through Students' Eyes,"Responding to students' writing consumes so much time, energy, and empathy, and yet, paradoxically, it is the element of our work that we least understand. In this workshop-style Cultivate session, we will examine the task of responding to student writing and explore how students read and understand our written comments. Participants will first read a student's draft and the teacher's comments and discuss this material in a small-group breakout. We will then show a video of a discourse-based interview with the student, exploring what sense the student made of the teacher's comments relative to the intentions for the paper. Together, we will explore the basic questions: What kind of reader do we become when we take up residence in the margins of our students' papers? How do our comments help students become confident writers? And we will raise questions about responding, given the constraints of faculty workload and the demands of specific student populations. From a discussion of one draft, we will move to a larger reflection on what it means to be a thoughtful reader of student writing."
