Participants will first read a student's draft and the teacher's comments and discuss this material in a small-group breakout. We will then show a video of a discourse-based interview with the student, exploring what sense the student made of the teacher's comments relative to the intentions for the paper. Together, we will explore the basic questions: What kind of reader do we become when we take up residence in the margins of our students' papers? How do our comments help students become confident writers? And we will raise questions about responding, given the constraints of faculty workload and the demands of specific student populations.
